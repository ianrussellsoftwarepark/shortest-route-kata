# Find the Shortest Route Kata in F\#

This repository contains the slides, images, and code that I used for a brownbag session at Trustbit on July 12, 2022. The session was recorded and will be available soon!

[Trustbit DDD Exercise 2.1](<https://github.com/trustbit/exercises/blob/master/transport-tycoon_21.md>)

In the session, I describe how I solved the kata in F#, using an exhaustive approach around a hierarchical data structure. The code fro this is in kata-tree.fsx.

I have also included the code from a more efficient method. This is in kata-loop.fsx.

Follow me on Twitter (@ijrussell) and have a look at the [Trustbit blog](<https://trustbit.tech/blog>).
