# Find the Shortest Route Kata in F\#

This repository contains the slides, images, and code that I used for a brownbag session at Trustbit on July 12, 2022. The session was recorded and will be available soon!

In the session, I describe how I solved the [find the shortest route kata](<https://github.com/trustbit/exercises/blob/master/transport-tycoon_21.md>) in F#, using an exhaustive approach around a hierarchical data structure. The code for this is in kata-tree.fsx.

I have also included the code from a more efficient method. This is in kata-loop.fsx.

As a bonus, I've added the code for Exercise 2.2 where we calculate the fastest route rather than the shortest. I have adapted the code from Exercise 2.1 to achieve this.

Have a look at the [Trustbit blog](<https://trustbit.tech/blog>) for more posts on F#, Domain-Driven Design, and Machine Learning.
